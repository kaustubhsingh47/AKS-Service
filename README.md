# LOGic APP

## Background and Strategic fit

Azure Logic Apps are established to provide the essential infrastructure services required to run their workloads. They are structured to facilitate the application onboarding process by setting up the necessary infrastructure at different levels. Logic Apps are critical in each level of the landing zones due to their role in automating and orchestrating the setup and management of these services. 

Enabling Logic Apps at each level of the landing zones is crucial to automate workflows and processes, reducing the need for manual intervention and ensuring consistent and efficient operations across all levels. They facilitate the integration of various services, enabling seamless communication and operation within the infrastructure.

Azure Logic Apps provide a scalable and flexible framework that can adapt to the evolving needs of applications and workloads. They improve monitoring, alerting, and maintenance of the infrastructure services, making the management of resources more effective.

 Role of Logic Apps in Landing Zones:

Logic App Landing Zone Level 0 establishes resource groups and role assignments for subscriptions, hubs, and resource groups. This level provides the initial setup needed for organizing and securing resources.

Logic App Landing Zone Level 1 includes networking, KeyVault, and storage accounts for storing artifacts. This level ensures that the essential infrastructure is in place for secure and efficient data storage and network communication.

Logic App Landing Zone Level 2 involves setting up application storage accounts, disk encryption, storage containers, KeyVault keys, network watchers, and app service environments. This level builds on the foundational services to provide the core infrastructure required by applications.

Logic App Landing Zone Level 3 includes configuring OS images, load balancers, VM scale sets, virtual machines, additional storage accounts, app service plans, Logic Apps, and storage shares. This level focuses on the specific infrastructure needed for running and scaling applications.


## Prerequisite 

To execute the Application Landing Zone Templates below are the steps required 

1. Add Private Hosted Zone Entry in Connectivity Landing Zone for Logic App Domains for setting up DNS resolution for the Logic Apps within the private network. By Adding private hosted zone entries ensures that the Logic Apps can resolve domain names within the private network securely, preventing exposure to the public internet and enhancing security and performance.

2. Create Resource Groups to organize resources such as Logic Apps, storage accounts, and networking components helps manage and organize them efficiently and User Assigned Managed Identities, Map Relevant Roles (e.g., Storage Contributor, Blob Contributor, etc) to enable secure access to Azure resources without storing credentials in the code.

3. Create VNet and Two Subnets, and Network Security Groups (NSG) and Subnet Security Groups (SG) to establish a secure network infrastructure for Logic Apps. It provides isolated and secure network connectivity for resources and separates different parts of the application to improve security and management.

4. Create Storage Account for logic Apps to store states, configuration, logs and the storage account is used to store connector definitions and other related metadata, Role Assignments Required for Logic App  have the required permissions to read, write, and manage data in the storage account.

5. Create Logic App Standard Environment provides a dedicated, scalable environment for running Logic Apps, ensuring better performance, reliability, and management capabilities. Environment Standardization Ensures that all Logic Apps operate in a consistent environment, simplifying management and troubleshooting.









## Architecture Design

This architecture diagram for logic apps illustrates a hybrid integration between Azure services and an on-premises SQL Server database, typically used to securely access on-premises data from cloud-based applications. Below a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. External Request: A request originates from an external source, such as a web application or a user, and is directed towards the cloud-based API Management service.

2. API Management: Azure API Management receives the request and acts as the gateway, handling tasks like authentication, authorization, and throttling.

3. Logic Apps: The request is then passed to Azure Logic Apps, a cloud-based service that automates workflows and integrates applications, data, and services across organizations.

- 3a. Azure Key Vault: Logic Apps can securely retrieve secrets and credentials from Azure Key Vault as needed for authentication and secure operations.
- 3b. On-premises Data Gateway: Logic Apps uses the On-premises Data Gateway to securely connect to on-premises resources.

4. On-premises Data Gateway: The gateway securely transmits requests from Logic Apps to the on-premises SQL Server. This gateway acts as a bridge, enabling secure communication between cloud services and on-premises resources.

5. SQL Server: The request reaches the on-premises SQL Server, which processes the query or command and returns the results.



### Technical Overview of App Service Environment v3 in a Landing Zone (LZ3)

App Service Environment v3, when integrated with Logic Apps and App Service Plan in a Landing Zone 3 (LZ3) architecture, provides a robust, secure, and scalable environment for deploying and managing enterprise applications. This setup ensures isolated and high-performance hosting, automated workflows, and seamless integration with both Azure and on-premises resources.

 Deploy ASEv3 in a dedicated VNet within the LZ3 architecture, ensuring isolation and network security. Allocate separate subnets for ASEv3 and other components such as Logic Apps and the On-premises Data Gateway.

Deploy Logic Apps to automate workflows, such as processing data or triggering actions based on specific events.  Use connectors to integrate Logic Apps with other services, such as SQL Server via the On-premises Data Gateway.

 Configure the gateway to allow secure data transfer between on-premises SQL Server and Logic Apps. Ensure hybrid connectivity scenarios are securely managed via VPN or ExpressRoute.



6. Azure Monitor: Throughout this process, Azure Monitor keeps track of the performance and health of the entire workflow, logging activities and potentially sending alerts if issues are detected.

By combining these components, this architecture allows for secure and managed access to on-premises data from cloud-based applications, ensuring security, scalability, and monitoring capabilities.
